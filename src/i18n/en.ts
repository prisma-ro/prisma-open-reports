        Due to rapid urbanization, many cities have become dangerous places. In
  recent years, cases of abuse and harassment have occurred much more frequently.
  <strong>8 out of 10 women do not feel safe</strong> when going out at night.
        <br />
        <br />
        And yet if a victim tries to get the help of a policeman and tells him
        that they were harassed, he will tell them that there's nothing he can do.
